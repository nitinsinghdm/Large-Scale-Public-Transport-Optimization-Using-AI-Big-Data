# Large-Scale-Public-Transport-Optimization-Using-AI-Big-Data

This project examines the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data analytics in the context of optimizing large-scale public transport systems, particularly Berlin’s GTFS datasets. The study focuses on two key objectives: delay prediction in public transport using machine learning and improving route optimization through graph algorithms. Within this framework, the project utilized static GTFS data from the VBB network, implementing both regression and classification models for trip delay estimation, and built a graph of the fastest routes to be computed via Dijkstra’s algorithm. Findings from the study indicate that classifying models are reasonably accurate in predicting delays with sparse real-time data, and optimization based on graph algorithms provides reasonable solutions for route planning. Although constrained by the absence of real-time GPS data or GTFS-RT feeds, the research underscores the value of static transit data in creating intelligent, scalable frameworks for urban mobility. The study is useful for transport authorities in providing evidence-based decision-making tools aimed at improving scheduling, mitigating delays, and augmenting overall passenger satisfaction.
